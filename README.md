Hi, 
This synth was designed as beginner project. Sound is created by four NE555 and, after mixing, filtered by MFOS WSG TL071-based filter.

The PWM generator is unnecessary complex. You can redesign this project and use single 555.
Rocker switch holes are on a joint. You can make them a bit bigger. 

You can create PCB at home as single-layer PCB with jumpers, but I included gerber files which you can send to PCB factory. I reccomend second option.
